***Description***

Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world â€” for every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.

***Objective***

In this project, I will use fictional raw data provided by the data scientists at Warby Parker to analyze Warby Parker marketing funnels by calculating conversion rates and other means of data manipulation.

***Description***

The Superstore is a fictional retail store that sells several products throughout the United States. Tableau provides this data source to every user for free. It is incredibly detailed and allows the users to create all kinds of dashboards. With the data set provided, I created and designed a dashboard that allows management of the Superstore to access all of their KPIs in one view, while allowing them to drill down further to discover some of their biggest failures and successes. 

***Objective***

In this project, I will use fictional raw data provided by the data scientists at Warby Parker to analyze Warby Parker marketing funnels by calculating conversion rates and other means of data manipulation.
