Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! This is the home base for all of my public projects that I have put together so far. I will continue to upload as I complete new assignments.

***What is Warby Parker?***
Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world â€” for every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.

***Objective***
In this project, I will use fictional raw data provided by the data scientists at Warby Parker to analyze Warby Parker marketing funnels by calculating conversion rates and other means of data manipulation.
